- 🙊 Hi, I’m 陈光 (you can call me Daniel), Russian student in University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, current studying Computer Science (started at sept. 2023)
- 📖 I’m interested in programming at all: algorithms, a lot of math and, of course, a lot of practice!
- 👾 I’m currently learning java language, already passed C language exam (thanks God it's 93 out of 100), interested in making software
- 🤝🏻 I’m looking to collaborate on useful java projects, maybe in future I will expand my language profile
- 📫 How to reach me? Good question, I guess only gitHub is the only one way.. (or maybe you have WeChat? 😂)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm studying IN CHINESE (所以怪不得我的汉语比我的英文好得多)
- 🏓 Another fact: usually instead of coding I'm playing table tennis (fcourse, why I came to study in China then?)
